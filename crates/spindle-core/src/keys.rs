//! Order-preserving key encodings for the durable log.
//!
//! The storage engine is an ordered key-value store, so a range scan over a
//! room's history is only correct if **byte order equals numeric order**. That
//! is not free for `LinearIndex`: it is an `i64`, backfilled history is
//! negative, and two's-complement negative numbers have their high bit set, so
//! a naive big-endian encoding sorts every backfilled event *after* every live
//! one — silently, with no error, producing a room whose history pages
//! backwards.
//!
//! Flipping the sign bit fixes it: `i64::MIN` maps to all-zero bytes and
//! `i64::MAX` to all-ones, and the mapping is monotonic across zero.
